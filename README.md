## Movie Search App
🎥🔍🌐

This is a web application built with React that allows users to search for movies using the Rapid API. Users can easily find information about movies, add them to their favorites ❤️, and toggle between light ☀️ and dark 🌙 mode for a personalized viewing experience.

### Features
* ✨ Movie Search: Users can enter keywords or movie titles in the search bar to retrieve a list of relevant movies. The app uses the Rapid API to fetch movie data, including titles, posters, release dates, and ratings.

* ❤️ Favorites: Users can mark movies as favorites by clicking on a heart icon associated with each movie. The selected movies are then added to the favorites list, which can be accessed and managed separately.

* ➕🗑️ Add and Remove from Favorites: Users can add movies to their favorites list by clicking on the heart icon. They can also remove movies from the favorites list by clicking on the heart icon again.

* 🌞🌑 Light and Dark Mode: The app provides a toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark mode. This feature enhances the user experience by providing different visual themes to suit personal preferences.
